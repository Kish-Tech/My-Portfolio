        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm Charles Njoroge, a passionate and dedicated web developer with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies. With a background in Business and Information Technology, I bring a unique combination of technical skills and business acumen to every project I work on. My journey into web development began with a deep interest in solving real-world problems using technology, and over the years, I've honed my skills through hands-on experience and continuous learning.</p>
        <p>I specialize in building dynamic and responsive websites using modern technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. My expertise also includes database management, API integration, and creating user-friendly interfaces. I have experience working with frameworks and libraries like React, Bootstrap, and Laravel, which help me deliver fast, scalable, and high-quality web solutions</p>
        <p>In addition to my technical skills, I’m a firm believer in the importance of good communication and collaboration. I work closely with clients to understand their needs and ensure that every project aligns with their vision. Whether it’s designing a responsive portfolio, creating an interactive web application, or optimizing user experiences, I strive to deliver exceptional results that exceed expectations.</p>
        <p>When I’m not coding, I enjoy learning new technologies, reading, and spending time with my family.</p>
